My name is Mohamed Aichaoui, and this repository contains an example of two common search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search, implemented in Java. 

- **Linear Search:** A simple algorithm that checks each element of an array sequentially until the target value is found or the entire array is searched.
- **Binary Search:** A more efficient algorithm for sorted arrays, which repeatedly divides the search space in half to quickly locate the target value.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of these two search methods for learning and comparison purposes. Feel free to explore and use the code for educational reasons.
